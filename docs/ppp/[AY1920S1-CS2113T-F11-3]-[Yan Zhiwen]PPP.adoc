== Product Overview

After being constantly spammed by the school emails and missing all kinds of important emails, our group
decided to develop this email manager to better organize our mailbox as a NUS Computing student.

Email Manager is an email and task manager app, specifically designed for NUS School of Computing students
to manage their emails and busy schedules. As a text-based application, it is optimized for those who
prefer typing and working with Command Line Interface (CLI). Email Manager also has a developed Graphical
User Interface (GUI) that allows users to view email and task details in an appealing, well-organized
format. If you can type fast, Email Manager can get your emails and tasks organized quickly and easily.

== Contributions to User Guide


=== Quick Start

This section serves as a tutorial for a new user to Email Manager.

[#installation]
==== Installation

. Ensure you have Java version 11 or later installed in your computer.
. Download the latest email_manager.zip https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-3/main/releases[here] and
extract it to a folder.
. If the download is too slow, please download it from https://drive.google.com[google drive].

[#run-email-manager]
==== Run Email Manager

[WARNING]
The program might freeze for a while when fetching and parsing the email. Please wait patiently.

===== Windows User

. Double click the jar file in the extracted folder.
. If any error occurs, try to follow the mac/linux user instructions to run the program from command line.

==== Mac/Linux User

. Open the command prompt.
. Change the working directory of the command prompt to the extracted program folder using `cd` command.
. Check java version using `java -version` command. It should be java 11.
. Run `java -jar email_manager-1.3.jar` and you are good to go.

[WARNING]
Make sure that your command prompt is at the directory of the folder extracted, otherwise the data
structure might not be recognised. Creating data file structure coming in v1.4

[TIP]
Please send an email to jokeryan1997@gmail.com if you cannot successfully run the program.

===== Use and Test with/without Internet

Our product can automatically parse and manage the emails in your mailbox. It is best to be used and tested
with Internet connection. If you do not have Internet connection, we have also prepared some data for you to
test offline.

* If you have Internet connection:
. You will be directed to a web page to authorize our access to your mailbox. Please login to the *dummy
email* we provided to you.

. Close the browser and return back to the Email Manager. Wait for a while for the email to be fetched
and parsed.

[WARNING]
Our product does not support non UTF-8 characters. Using your own mailbox for
testing may lead to redundant saving and loading with the current version. More charsets will be supported
in v2.0

* If you do not have Internet connection:
. Paste everything under `test_data` file in the program folder, to the `data` folder. Replace all the files
in the `data` folder.
. Close the Email Manager and Start it again.
. Wait for a while for all the emails to be parsed.

==== Introducing the Interface

.Main Window
[#main-window]
[caption="Figure 2: Main window of Email Manager"]
image::MainWindow.png[Main Window, 800]

As shown in Figure 2, the main window of Email Manager has three sections.

* On the left, it is the command interface, where you should be entering your command and get response from
the Email Manager.
* In the middle, it is the task list, which displays all tasks information.
* On the right, it is the email list and content display. You can press `Esc` key on your keyboard any time
to switch display between the list and content view of emails.

=== Email Features

The command listed here can only be used under email mode/prefix. Use `flip` command to toggle the mode.

==== Auto parsing and tagging of emails
This feature is automatically triggered by fetching emails from Outlook Server and adding new kayword. It
will automatically parse "keywords" that might be  shown in your emails in different forms/expressions.

For example, the keyword `CS2113T` might be in the expression of `CS2113T`, `CS2113`, `Akshay Narayan`,
`Akshay` etc. All emails containing these expressions will be recognized as containing the keyword
`CS2113T`. This helps the email manager to better categorize your emails. For example, some emails might not
explicitly include the module code, still belong to that module as it is sent by the lecturer.

For easier usage and testing, we have prepared a few default keyword + expressions pair as shown in Figure
3, which will be loaded when the program starts.

[#default-keywords]
[caption="Figure 3: Default keywords of email auto-parsing"]
image::defaultKeywords.png[Default Keywords, 400]

If the email contains some expressions, the respective keyword will be used to tag that email. It can be
seen from the `#` sign on the email list. When showing the email using `show` command, the parsed
expressions will also be highlighted in yellow.

[NOTE]
The parsing only allows exact matching of words, which means expression `2113` will not be matched with
text `CS2113`. Any extra characters before and after the word will not be accepted. This is to avoid
unintentional match for short expressions. Please add more expressions if you want more matching patterns.

[NOTE]
Some emails have pictures in it, and obviously we do not intend to capture the words in those pictures.

[TIP]
To test this feature, you are recommended to use `addKeyword` command, or sending email to the dummy
mailbox. Remember to call `fetch` command after sending and leave a few seconds for the email to be
transmitted before calling the `fetch`.

==== Add Keyword: `addKeyword`
Format: `addKeyword KEYWORD -exp EXPRESSION1 [-exp EXPRESSION2]...` +
Adds a keyword or expressions to the keyword list. If the keyword is already in the list, the expression
will be added to the expressions belonging to that keyword. So this is a command to add both keyword and
expression.

[TIP]
The easiest way to verify whether this command is working properly is to check whether the email
containing the expression has a tag of this keyword in the email list, or just use `show ITEM_NUMBER`
command to see whether the expressions are correctly highlighted.

[NOTE]
All emails will be parsed again upon the updates in keyword and expression, so the window might freeze for
a while. Please wait patiently.

=== Email Management

==== Email Auto Parsing

The emails fetched or stored locally will be automatically parsed to extract important information for
tagging, task creation and reminder purposes. The parsing consists of two stages, the *format parsing* and
*content parsing*. Email format parsing is to parse the email components like subject, sender and body from
the raw string fetched from the server or stored in local file. The content parsing is to parse the keyword
included all components of email.

===== Email Format Parsing
.Email Format Parsing
[#img-email-format-parsing]
[caption="Figure N: "]
image::EmailFormatParseHelper.png[Format Parsing, 800]
The email format parsing starts at the call of `ParseFetchResponse(response)`. The variable `response` here
is a string of the http response from the Outlook server to the fetch API call.

It first creates an `EmailList` to store all the emails parsed from the response. This function only
returns the list instead of directly adding the
email parsed to the model because the storage or network component will decide whether and how the emails
are to added to the model.

Then each email contained in the response of is parsed to a `JSONObject` called `emailJson` for easier
manipulation.

With this `emailJson`, `parseComponentsToEmail(emailJson)` is called to extract different components of the
json and instantiate an `Email` object to be added to the `emailList` created earlier.

This process repeats until all the email information in the response is processed.
