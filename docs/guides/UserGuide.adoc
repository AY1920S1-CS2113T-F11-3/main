=== Introducing the Interface

.Main Window
[#main-window]
[caption="Figure 2: Main window of Email Manager"]
image::annotatedUI.png[Main Window, 800]

As shown in Figure 2, the main window of Email Manager has three sections.

* On the left, it is the command interface, where you should be entering your command and get response from
the Email Manager.
* In the middle, it is the task list, which displays all tasks information.
* On the right, it is the email list and content display. You can press `Esc` key on your keyboard any time
to switch display between the list and content view of emails.

=== Try It Out!
Now that you understand the appâ€™s interface, you can now try keying in commands to interact with Email Manager. +
Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. +
All commands have a prefix, indicating whether the command belongs to the `Email` Mode or the `Task`
Mode. The default prefix is `Email` and you can always enter a `flip` command to toggle between `Email`
and `Task`. +
e.g. typing help and pressing Enter opens the help window. +
Some example commands you can try in task mode:

* `list`: lists all tasks
* `deadline submit report -time 12/12/2019 2359`: adds a deadline task named submit report to your task list
* `event meeting -time 10/09/2019 1200 -tag work`:  adds an event task named meeting to your task list.

Some example commands you can try in email mode:

* `list`: lists all the emails
* `show 3`: shows the 3rd email shown in the email list

Some example commands you can try in both modes:

* `flip`: toggle between email and task command
* `bye` : exits the app
Refer to Features for details of each command.

== Features

This section tells you about the features available in Email Manager and how to use them.

Command Format

To learn more about these parameters, go to their respective sections:
<<doafter>>, <<priority>>.

[TIP]
For the following commands, you are able to enter the optional parameters in any order
as long as they are entered after the compulsory parameters.

===== Adding a todo: `todo`
Format: `todo TASK_NAME [-doafter DOAFTER_TASK][-priority PRIORITY_LEVEL][-tag TAG1]...`

[TIP]
Parameters other than item number can be entered in any order.

[NOTE]
PRIORITY_LEVEL is restricted to *high*, *med*, *low*. Any other PRIORITY_LEVEL will be invalid.

===== Adding an deadline: `deadline`
Format: `deadline TASK_NAME -time dd/mm/yyyy hhMM [-doafter DOAFTER_TASK][-priority PRIORITY_LEVEL][-tag TAG1]...`

Adds a task that has a deadline. The task name and deadline are required.
A doafter task, priority level or any number of tags are all optional.
Order of the modifiers do not matter.

Examples:

`deadline categorise -time 31/11/2019 2359`

`deadline submission -time 31/10/2019 2359 -doafter coding -priority high -tag fun`

`deadline submission -time Thu 2359`

[TIP]
Parameters other than item number can be entered in any order. +
Natural date format can be used instead of ISO date format.

[NOTE]
Valid ISO date format is in the form of `dd/mm/yyyy hhMM`, input such as `dd/m/yyyy hhMM` for example
`1/3/2019` is invalid.

[NOTE]

the task including all the attributes and signifier. (Case insensitive) +

Example:
`find cat` will return `cat`, `tabby #cat`, `SoCcat`, `concatenation`

[TIP]
`find` command has a lot of flexibility in usage. If the user wants to find all deadlines, they can search
using `find by:` since all deadlines will contain a `by:` as shown in the list. This is also applicable to
keywords like `Overdue` and `Past`.

command using `flip`.

==== Listing all emails: `list`
Format: `list`

Gives a complete list of emails.

==== Showing an email: `show`
Format: `show INDEX_NUMBER`

Show the email content of the email at the index number in the email list.

Example:
`show 3`

[TIP]
You can press `Esc` key on your keyboard any time to switch display between the list and content view of emails.

==== Fetching emails from server: `fetch`
Format: `fetch`

Fetches email from Outlook.com.

[WARNING]
The window might freeze for a while as it is fetching and parsing emails. Please wait patiently.

==== Fuzzy search on emails
Format: `fuzzySearch TARGET`

This feature searches for the target string across all emails including their subject, sender and body,
with some tolerance of difference. This tolerance is represented by the **edit distance** between two words.
For more details about the **edit distance**, you can find more details
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance[here]. The lower the **edit distance** is, the more similar are
these two strings.

This fuzzy search functionality tolerates up to an **edit distance** of 2 and is insensitive to cases. It
will list all the emails which contain the target string in their subject, sender or body. Emails are
listed in descending order of a **relevance score**. The general idea is, the higher the score, the more
relevant is the email. It is calculated in the following formula:

==== Auto parsing and tagging of emails
This feature is automatically triggered by fetching emails from Outlook Server and adding new keyword. It
will automatically parse "keywords" that might be  shown in your emails in different forms/expressions.

For example, the keyword `CS2113T` might be in the expression of `CS2113T`, `CS2113`, `Akshay Narayan`,
`Akshay` etc. All emails containing these expressions will be recognized as containing the keyword
`CS2113T`. This helps the email manager to better categorize your emails. For example, some emails might not
explicitly include the module code, still belong to that module as it is sent by the lecturer.

For easier usage and testing, we have prepared a few default keyword + expressions pair as shown in Figure
3, which will be loaded when the program starts.

[#default-keywords]
[caption="Figure 3: Default keywords of email auto-parsing"]
image::defaultKeywords.png[Default Keywords, 400]

If the email contains some expressions, the respective keyword will be used to tag that email. It can be
seen from the `#` sign on the email list. When showing the email using `show` command, the parsed
expressions will also be highlighted in yellow (except for SPAMs).

[NOTE]
The parsing only allows exact matching of words, which means expression `2113` will not be matched with
text `CS2113`. Any extra characters before and after the word will not be accepted. This is to avoid
unintentional match for short expressions. Please add more expressions if you want more matching patterns.

[NOTE]
Some emails have pictures in it, and obviously we do not intend to capture the words in those pictures.

[TIP]
To test this feature, you are recommended to use `addKeyword` command, or sending email to the dummy
mailbox. Remember to call `fetch` command after sending and leave a few seconds for the email to be
transmitted before calling the `fetch`.

==== Add Keyword: `addKeyword`
Format: `addKeyword KEYWORD -exp EXPRESSION1 [-exp EXPRESSION2]...`
Adds a keyword or expressions to the keyword list. If the keyword is already in the list, the expression
will be added to the expressions belonging to that keyword. So this is a command to add both keyword and
expression.

Examples:

`addKeyword Project -exp project -exp demo`

`addKeyword Notice -exp announcement`

[TIP]
The easiest way to verify whether this command is working properly is to check whether the email
containing the expression has a tag of this keyword in the email list, or just use `show ITEM_NUMBER`
command to see whether the expressions are correctly highlighted. Please call the `show` command again
after adding the keyword if you have already opened an email.

[NOTE]
All emails will be parsed again upon the updates in keyword and expression, so the window might freeze for
a while. Please wait patiently.

==== Listing all keywords: `listKeyword`
Format: `listKeyword`

Gives a list of all keywords with the relevant expressions.

==== Delete keyword (coming in v1.4)

==== Tagging Email: `update`
Format: `update ITEM_NUMBER -tag TAG1 [-tag TAG2]...`

Tags the specified item with the tag(s) minimum number of tags is 1. Tags without duplication will be added.

Examples:

`update 1 -tag CS2113T`

`update 2 -tag Tutorial -tag Spam`

==== Listing all tags: `listTag`
Format: `listTag`

Gives a list of all existing tags in the list of emails.

==== Filtering email: `list`
Format: `list [-tag TAG1] [-tag TAG2]...`

Gives a list of emails with the tags. Minimum number of tags is 1, and the maximum number of tags is 2.

Examples:

`list -tag CS2113T -tag Tutorial`

`list -tag Spam`

==== Deleting email: `delete`
Format: `delete ITEM_NUMBER`

Deletes the item specified.

Examples:

`delete 1`: deletes the first email

[NOTE]
If you enter `show ITEM_NUMBER`, then followed with `delete ITEM_NUMBER`, the content of email at
`ITEM_NUMBER` will still remains displayed although the email has been deleted.

==== Clear email list: `clear`
Format: `clear`

This command deletes all emails in the list.

[WARNING]
Once executed, you will not be able to undo this command.

[TIP]
After clearing all the emails, you can enter `fetch` to retrieve latest emails from server.

==== Sending email (coming in v2.0)

==== Auto delete emails (coming in v2.0)

==== Linking emails to tasks (coming in v2.0)

==== Apply priority level (coming in v2.0)

=== Saving data
Data is automatically saved after any command modifies the file. +
