== Introduction

Welcome to the *Email Manager* Developer Guide! +
*Email Manager* is an email and task manager app, specifically designed for NUS School of Computing Students
to manage their emails and busy schedules. As a text-based application, it is optimized for those who prefer typing and working with Command Line Interface (CLI). Email Manager also has a developed Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to view email and task details in an appealing, well-organized format.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features in Email Manager are implemented.

=== Natural dates Support

==== Rationale

The email manager aims to help computing students handle their tasks efficiently. Therefore, one of its main
goals is to speed up the process at which students enter their task details so that their task can be added
into the task list quickly. The benefits of having this Natural Dates support are:

* Reduce the time and effort needed to key in the date and time for deadline and event tasks.

==== Implementation

The Natural Dates support is facilitated by two main classes, namely `TaskCommandParseHelper` and `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper`.

`TaskParseNaturalDateHelper` is an element of the will retrieve the parsed time string from
`TaskCommandParseHelper` and convert
the extracted string to LocalDateTime format. It implements the following operations:

* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#isCorrectNaturalDate(input)` - Checks if input contains natural date format.
* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#convertNaturalDate(day, time)` - Converts string day and time to local date in
LocalTimeDate format.
* `TaskParseNaturalDateHelper#getDate(input)` - Returns a date and time(if applicable) after checking if
natural date input contains a time element.

`TaskCommandParseHelper` is an element of the Command component. It handles all parsing of inputs when the
input type is set to `task`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how Natural Dates Support behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application. The input type is currently in `email` mode. The user wishes
to add a task and key in `flip` to switch input type to `task` mode.

Step 2: The user executes `deadline homework -time Mon 1200` to add a new deadline task. The `deadline`
command calls `TaskCommandParseHelper#parseAddTaskCommand()`, which parses and extracts the relevant
information that are included in the command and saves it inside a list of type `ArrayList<Command.Option>`.

Step 3: The user wishes to update the date and time for the task above, . The user executes `update `

[appendix]
== Non-Functional Requirements

Email Manager meets the following non-functional requirements:

* Security of user login credentials (user enters details directly into Microsoft portal)
* Data Accessibility (efficient storage)should we take this out?
* Time-out take this out as well?
* Clean layout
* Works with common operating systems
