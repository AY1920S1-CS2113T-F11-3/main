== Introduction

Welcome to the Email Manager Developer Guide! +
Email Manager is an email and task manager app, specifically designed for NUS
School of Computing Students to manage their emails and busy schedules. As a
text-based application, it is optimized for those who prefer typing and working with Command Line Interface (CLI).
Email Manager also has a developed Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to view email
and task details in an appealing, well-organized format.

== About the Developer Guide

This developer guide provides detailed documentation on the implementation of all the various
features Email Manager offers. It also suggests methods for you to modify and build upon it. +
Throughout this developer guide, there will be various icons used, as shown below:

[WARNING]
This is a warning. Heed these warnings to avoid making mistakes that will hamper your development efforts.

== Setting up

This section shows how to set up Email Manager on your desktop and begin your development journey.

== Design
=== Architecture

Figure 1. Architecture Diagram +
The _Architecture Diagram_ given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other


=== UI component

=== Logic component

=== Model component

=== Storage component

=== Common classes

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// Maybe in the future we split the sub-sections into overall command structure, email management, task management and GUI?

=== Task Management
There are three main types of tasks that Email Manager works with: `todo`, `deadline` and `event`.


==== Current Implementation
Tasks have a variety of attributes that a user wants to add or change. The current attributes that
can be modified are: `time`, `doafter`, `priority` and `tags`.
The updating of task details is facilitated by `TaskUpdateCommand`. It extends `Command`, overriding the `execute` method.

The details of the update mechanism are as follows:

Step 1: `TaskCommandParseHelper` takes in the command from the user input text field, and parses it.
If the command starts with `update` than it will separate all the parameters into an ArrayList,
passing it into the `TaskUpdateCommand`.

Step 2: `TaskUpdateCommand.execute()` will then go through the ArrayList, calling the appropriate
method in `TaskList`.

Step 3: The method in `TaskList` will retrieve the specified task and call the related setter to change the value.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Handling Tags
* Alternative 1 (current choice): if at least one tag is entered as part of the command, it will overwrite all current tags of the task being modified.
** Pros: makes it consistent with other parameters of the update command and gives users an option to replace/remove tags
** Cons: if there are many tags, and the user only wants to add on an extra tag, the user will need to retype all existing tags into the command.
* Alternative 2: if a tag is entered as part of the command, it will amend on top of existing tags.
** Pros: this will save users time if they only want to add on tags
** Cons: no option to remove tags
* Alternative 3 (proposed): there will be an option to add tags and an option to remove tags.
** Pros: gives users highest amount of flexibility and control over the tags they want to keep.
** Cons: added complexity in commands

. System presents the user with all current priority settings
. The user selects “New” from the menu
. System displays a text box for input of keyword/regular expression.
. The user types in the keyword/regular expression, selects the priority level of this keyword and selects “Save” and confirm

*Use Case: View Email List with Priority*

. The user selects “All Email” from the menu
. The user selects “by Priority” from the menu
