== Introduction

Welcome to the Email Manager Developer Guide! +
Email Manager is an email and task manager app, specifically designed for NUS School of Computing Students to manage their emails and busy schedules. As a text-based application, it is optimized for those who prefer typing and working with Command Line Interface (CLI). Email Manager also has a developed Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to view email and task details in an appealing, well-organized format.

This developer guide provides detailed documentation on the implementation of all the various features Email Manager offers. It also suggests methods for you to modify and build upon it. +
Throughout this developer guide, there will be various icons used, as shown below:

== Implementation

=== Email Auto Parsing

The emails fetched or stored locally will be automatically parsed to extract important information for
tagging, task creation and reminder purposes. The parsing consists of two stages, the *format parsing* and
*content parsing*. Email format parsing is to parse the email components like subject, sender and body from
the raw string fetched from the server or stored in local file. The content parsing is to parse the keyword
included all components of email.

==== Email Format Parsing
.Email Format Parsing

image::EmailFormatParseHelper.png[Format Parsing, 800]
The email format parsing starts at the call of `ParseFetchResponse(response)`. The variable `response` here
is a string of the http response from the Outlook server to the fetch API call.

It first creates an `EmailList` to store all the emails parsed from the response. This function only
returns the list instead of directly adding the
email parsed to the model because the storage or network component will decide whether and how the emails
are to added to the model.

Then each email contained in the response of is parsed to a `JSONObject` called `emailJson` for easier
manipulation.

With this `emailJson`, `parseComponentsToEmail(emailJson)` is called to extract different components of the
json and instantiate an `Email` object to be added to the `emailList` created earlier.

This process repeats until all the email information in the response is processed.

==== Email Content Parsing
.Email Content Parsing
[#img-email-content-parsing]
[caption="Figure N+1: "]
image::EmailContentParseHelper.png[Content Parsing, 800]

Email content parsing is to parse the keyword from different components of an email.

Email content parsing starts with the calling of `allKeywordInEmail(email)` and parse in the email in
`Email` type.

It then gets all the `KeywordPair` from the `KeywordList`. A `KeywordPair` contains a human readable
`keyword` signifying the "meaning" of the keyword. It also contains multiple `expressions` which will be
looked through the email for matches.

For each email component (subject, sender, body etc), the `keywordInString(emailComponent, keywordPair)` is
called to search for matches across these components. It will then return a relevance score. Higher
relevance score means a more occurrence. Keyword with all its expressions absent in the email will get a 0
relevance score. Also, subject and sender will have a higher weights compared to the email body.

Each keyword searched in the email with a relevance score higher than 0 (at least 1 occurrence), will be
added to the email as a tag by calling `addTag(keywordPair, relevanceScore)`.

System: Email Manager +
Actor: User (SoC student)

*Use Case: Fetch email from account* +
1. User starts system or enters the fetch command.. +
2. System retrieves account key from file, connects to Microsoft and logs in. New emails are retrieved, combined with those from local storage and displayed. +
Use case ends. +
Extensions: +
2a. System is unable to retrieve a valid account key, receives error from Microsoft. +
2a1. Opens Microsoft portal in browser. +
2a2. The user types in the username and password into Microsoft portal. +
2a3. System saves the account key from Microsoft for future logins, downloads new emails, and displays email. +
Use case ends.

2b. System does not receive a response from Microsoft server. +
	2b1. System notifies user of failure to log in and loads email from local file. +
	Use case ends.

*Use Case: Set priority to different keyword*

. The user selects the “Keyword Priority” from the menu
. System presents the user with all current priority settings
. The user selects “New” from the menu
. System displays a text box for input of keyword/regular expression.
. The user types in the keyword/regular expression, selects the priority level of this keyword and selects “Save” and confirm

*Use Case: View Email List with Priority*

. The user selects “All Email” from the menu
. The user selects “by Priority” from the menu
. System displays all the priorities and keywords under each priority
. The user selects the priority range that he/she wants to view
. System leads the user back to the email list page

	Extension: +
3.1. The user can include or exclude a particular keyword from that priority

*Use Case: Auto categorisation of emails*

. User creates a new categorize name.
. User specifies the keyword for this category.
. The app will look through the emails and put the related-emails under the category.


=== Appendix E: Non-Functional Requirements

Email Manager meets the following non-functional requirements:

* Security of user login credentials (user enters details directly into Microsoft portal)
* Data Accessibility (efficient storage)should we take this out?
* Time-out take this out as well?
* Clean layout
* Works with common operating systems
