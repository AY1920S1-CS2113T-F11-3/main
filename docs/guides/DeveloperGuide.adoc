. *Introduction*

Welcome to the Email Manager Developer Guide! +
Email Manager is an email and task manager app, specifically designed for NUS School of Computing Students to manage their emails and busy schedules. As a text-based application, it is optimized for those who prefer typing and working with Command Line Interface (CLI). Email Manager also has a developed Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to view email and task details in an appealing, well-organized format.

System: Email Manager +
Actor: User (SoC student)

*Use Case: Fetch email from account* +

2a. System is unable to retrieve a valid account key, receives error from Microsoft. +
2a1. Opens Microsoft portal in browser. +
2a2. The user types in the username and password into Microsoft portal. +
2a3. System saves the account key from Microsoft for future logins, downloads new emails, and displays email. +
Use case ends.

2b. System does not receive a response from Microsoft server. +
	2b1. System notifies user of failure to log in and loads email from local file. +
	Use case ends.

*Use Case: Set priority to different keyword*

. The user selects the ‚ÄúKeyword Priority‚Äù from the menu
. System presents the user with all current priority settings
. The user selects ‚ÄúNew‚Äù from the menu
. System displays a text box for input of keyword/regular expression.
. The user types in the keyword/regular expression, selects the priority level of this keyword and selects ‚ÄúSave‚Äù and confirm

*Use Case: View Email List with Priority*

. The user selects ‚ÄúAll Email‚Äù from the menu
. The user selects ‚Äúby Priority‚Äù from the menu
. System displays all the priorities and keywords under each priority
. The user selects the priority range that he/she wants to view
. System leads the user back to the email list page

	Extension: +
3.1. The user can include or exclude a particular keyword from that priority

*Use Case: Auto categorisation of emails*

. User specifies the keyword for this category.
. The app will look through the emails and put the related-emails under the category.


*Appendix E: Non-Functional Requirements*

Email Manager meets the following non-functional requirements:

* Security of user login credentials (user enters details directly into Microsoft portal)
* Data Accessibility (efficient storage)should we take this out?
* Time-out take this out as well?
* Clean layout
* Works with common operating systems
