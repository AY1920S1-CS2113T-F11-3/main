PROJECT: Duke Email Manager

== Product Overview

My team and I developed an Email Manager as a solution for the overwhelming emails received daily in our
mailbox.

We were tasked with enhancing a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) task manager for our Software
Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an email manager while enhancing the task manager. We also
provide ways to link the management between tasks and emails.

*Duke Email Manager* is an email and task manager desktop app, specifically designed for NUS School of
Computing Students to manage their emails and busy schedules. As a text-based application, it is optimized for those
who prefer typing and working with CLI. Email Manager also has a developed Graphical User Interface (GUI)
that allows users to view email and task details in an appealing, well-organized format.

The figure below shows interface of our app:

TODO: Annotate this image

My role was mainly to design and write the codes for email managing including email showing, email tagging
and email filtering. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the
relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

=== Code contributed
https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=ziyun99[Summary of code contribution]

=== Enhancement added

* Email Tagging
** What it does: Students can tag their emails with the command `email update <index> -tag <TagName1> -tag
<TagName2> ...`
** Justification: By tagging the emails, students can have a clearer overview of their list of
emails. Hence, they can attend important emails in the fastest time. This also minimizes the chances of
missing out crucial information being informed by email.
** Highlights: Multiple tags can be added to an email. Duplicated tags can be detected and not added to the
email again.
** Code contributed: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-3/main/pull/82[#82]

* Email Filtering by Tag(s)
** What it does: Students can filter the emails by the tags added with the command `email list -tag
<TagName1> -tag <TagName2>`
** Justification: This allows the students to view the list of emails being tagged with particular tag(s),
helping them to filter out relevant emails to keep their email organised.
** Highlights: Maximum number of input tags allowed is two, this will shows emails that are tagged with
both tags.
** Code contributed: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-3/main/pull/97[#97] https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-3/main/pull/105[#105]

* Email Showing
** What it does: The command `email show <index>` will display the email in html format.
** Justification: Student can view the content of email in the application without have to find the email
in other places. This helps the student to access all the information in the email all in one place.
** Highlights: Pressing `ESC` key can toggle the display between email list view and email content view.
** Code contributed:  https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-3/main/pull/71[#71]

* Switching mode between email and task
** What it does: Students can easily switch the mode between `email` and `task` with the command `flip`. In
the user input text field, a prefix either `email` or `task` will be displayed with
respect to the current mode.
** Justification: Students will need to frequently change their input when they try to handle their tasks
and emails, this feature allows them to navigate between both modes easily.
** Highlights: The prefix in the user input text field is design to reduce the amount of typing required
from the students. The prefix is non-deletable.
** Code contributed: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-F11-3/main/pull/54[#54]

== Contributions to the User Guide
We had to update the  User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added. The following is
an excerpt from our Email Manager User Guide, showing additions that I have made for the email managing
features.

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Change Mode: `flip`
Format: `flip` +

Flips/toggles between email mode and task mode. The prefix of the command in the text box will also be
changed.

In task mode, the text box will display `task` as a prefix.
In email mode, the text box will display `email` as a prefix.

=== Showing an email: `show`
Format: `show INDEX_NUMBER` +

Show the email content of the email at the index number in the email list.

Example: +
`show 3`: show the 3rd email in the list.

[TIP]
You can press `Esc` key on your keyboard any time to switch display between the list and content view of emails.


=== Tagging Email: `update`
Format: `update ITEM_NUMBER -tag TAG1 [-tag TAG2]...`

Tags the specified item with the tag(s) minimum number of tags is 1.

Examples: +
`update 1 -tag CS2113T` +
`update 2 -tag Tutorial -tag Spam`

=== Filtering email: `list`
Format: `list [-tag TAG1] [-tag TAG2]...` +

Gives a list of emails with the tags. Minimum number of tags is 1, and the maximum number of tags is 2.

Examples: +
`list -tag CS2113T -tag Tutorial` +
`list -tag Spam`

=== Email Management

==== Email Tagging
*Email Manager* allows user to tag emails by tags.

===== Current Implementation
* Format: `email update ITEM_NUMBER [-tag TAG1] [-tag TAG2]…`​
* Note: Tags the specified item with the tag(s) minimum number of tags is 1.
* Eg: `email update 2 -tag Fun -tag Project` : tags 2nd email in the list with the tags "Fun" and "Project".

Following is the activity diagram when the command is executed:
[#img-email-tag-activity-diagram]
[caption="Figure N+1: "]
image::emailTagActivityDiagram.jpg[Email Tag Activity Diagram, 800, caption="sf"]

The following sequence diagram below will explain how the `email update` command works in detail:

[#img-email-tag-sequence-diagram]
[caption="Figure N+1: "]
image::emailTagSequenceDiagram.jpg[Email Tag Sequence Diagram, 800]

An example usage of the command is as follows:

*Step 1*: The user launches the application. The user inputs `email update 2 -tag Fun -tag Project`

*Step 2*: `UI` component captures the input and passes to `Logic` component to parse the input. Section below
explains how `Logic` component parse the input.

* `CommandParseHelper` takes in the `input`, parses and extracts tags information and stores it
inside ArrayList<Option>  `optionList`, then passes the `input` and `optionList` to `EmailCommandParseHelper`.
** `input` here is `email update 2`
** `optionList` here is `[tag=Fun, tag=Project]`
* `EmailCommandParseHelper` parses the `index` of email and extract tags information `optionList` and
stores it in ArrayList<String> `tags`.
** `index` here is `2`
** `tags` here is `[Fun, Project]`
* `EmailCommandParseHelper` creates a new `EmailTagCommand` by passing in `index` and `tags`, then return
the `EmailTagCommand` to `CommandParseHelper` and then to `UI`

*Step 3* : `EmailTagCommand#execute(model)` is called by `UI`.

*Step 4*: `EmailTagCommand` calls `Model#getEmailList()`, then `emailList` is returned by `Model`.

*Step 5*: `EmailTagCommand` calls `EmailList#addTags(index, tags)`

* `EmailList` calls `get(index)` to get the email of the index number in the emailList.
** Gets the 2nd email in the emailList.
* For each `tag` in `tags`, `EmailList` calls `Email#addTag(tag)`. `Email` calls `tags.add()` to add the tag to the email.
** Each `tag` here is `Fun` and `Project`.

*Step 6*: `EmailList` returns a String `responseMsg` to `EmailTagCommand`.

** `responseMsg` here is: +
 "Tags added: [Project, Fun] to email: <title of email at index 2>"

===== Design Considerations

Aspect: Handling updating of tags

* Alternative 1 (current choice): if at least one tag is entered as part of the command, it will overwrite all current tags of the task being modified.
** Pros: makes it consistent with other parameters of the update command and gives users an option to replace/remove tags
** Cons: if there are many tags, and the user only wants to add on an extra tag, the user will need to retype all existing tags into the command.
* Alternative 2: if a tag is entered as part of the command, it will amend on top of existing tags.
** Pros: this will save users time if they only want to add on tags
** Cons: no option to remove tags
* Alternative 3 (proposed): there will be an option to add tags and an option to remove tags.
** Pros: gives users highest amount of flexibility and control over the tags they want to keep.
** Cons: added complexity in commands

==== Email Filtering by Tag(s)
*Email Manager* allows user to filter emails by tag(s).

===== Current Implementation
* Format: `list [-tag TAG1] [-tag TAG2]…`
* Note: Gives a list of emails with the tags. Minimum number of tags is 1, and the maximum is 2.
* Eg: `email list -tag Fun -tag Project`

Following is the activity diagram when the command is executed:
[#img-email-filter]
[caption="Figure n: "]
image::emailFilterActivityDiagram.jpg[Email Filtering Activity Diagram, 800]

The following sequence diagram below will explain how the `email update` command works in detail:

[#img-email-filter-sequence-diagram]
[caption="Figure N+1: "]
image::emailFilterSequenceDiagram.jpg[Email Filter Sequence Diagram, 800]

An example usage of the command is as follows:

*Step 1* : The user launches the application. The user wishes to tag the 2nd email in the list with "Fun"
and "Project" (Implementation of part is explained in Section 5.3.2). After tagging the email, the user wishes
to view the list of emails with these tags, hence the user inputs `email list -tag Fun -tag Project`.

*Step 2* : `UI` component captures the input and passes to `Logic` component to parse the input. Section below
explains how `Logic` component parse the input.

* `CommandParseHelper` takes in the `input`, parses and extracts tags information and stores it
inside ArrayList<Option>  `optionList`, then passes the `input` and `optionList` to `EmailCommandParseHelper`.
** `input` here is `email list`
** `optionList` here is `[tag=Fun, tag=Project]`
* `EmailCommandParseHelper` parses the `input` and extract tags information `optionList` and
stores it in ArrayList<String> `tags`.
** `tags` here is `[Fun, Project]`
* `EmailCommandParseHelper` creates a new `EmailTagListCommand` by passing in `tags`, then return
the `EmailTagListCommand` to `CommandParseHelper` and then to `UI`

*Step 3* : `EmailTagListCommand#execute(model)` is called by `UI`.

*Step 4*: `EmailTagListCommand` calls `EmailTags#displayEmailTagList(tags)`.

*Step 5*: `EmailTags` checks the conditions of the each tags in `tags`, we say that a tag exists if there
is email with the tag. If none of the emails has the tag, we say that the tag does not exist. We say that
both tags co-exist if there is email tagged with both tags.

** In this example, both tags `Fun` and `Project` co-exist.

*Step 6*: `EmailTags` call `TagMap.get("Fun").get("Project")`. `TagMap` returns `emailList` which is the
email(s) tagged with both `Fun` and `Project`.

*Step 7*: `EmailTags` returns a String `responseMsg` to `EmailTagListCommand`.

** `responseMsg` here is: +
"Here is the email tagged with both #Project and #Fun: <list of title of email(s)
with both tags>"


===== Design Considerations

* Alternative 1 (current choice): +
The tags associated with emails is stored in `TagMap`:

** TagMap is a `HashMap<String, SubTagMap>`:
*** Each `key` in the HashMap is a tag name (we call it `root tag name` here) that exists in the email list.
*** The `value` associated with each `key` is a `SubTagMap`.

** `SubTagMap` is a `HashMap<String, EmailList>`:
*** Each `key` in the HashMap is a tag name (we call it `sub tag name` here) that co-exists with the `root tag
name` from the `TagMap`. We say that both tags co-exist if there is email tagged with both tags.
*** The `value` associated with each `key` is an `EmailList`, which is the list of emails tagged with both
`root tag name` and `sub tag name`.

** For example, let `emailOne` be an email tagged with `Tutorial` and `CS2113T`, `emailTwo` be an email tagged
with `Tutorial` and `CG2271`.
*** After calling `EmailTags#updateEmailTagList`, the TagMap has the following structure: +
{ +
    Tutorial={Tutorial=emailOne emailTwo, CS2113T=emailOne, CG2271=emailTwo}, +
    CS2113T={CS2113T=emailOne, Tutorial=emailOne}, +
    CG2271={CG2271=emailTwo, Tutorial= emailTwo} +
}

** Pros: Faster search when user invokes `EmailTagListCommand`, since `EmailTags#displayEmailTagList` is
navigating in the HashMap.
** Cons: Current implementation invokes the `EmailTags#updateEmailTagList` on every user input to keep the
tagMap and email list view in GUI updated, which increases the computational load.

* Alternative 2: +
Loop through each tag of each email in the list of emails, and check if the each tag equals to the tag
requested by the user, if yes, add the email to the list, if no, continue with the loop. After finishing
the loop, output the email(s) in the list.

** Pros: This implementation does not have to maintain a TagMap structure to keep track of the emails with
the tags, therefore does not requires update of the TagMap, this saves the space and computational load of the program.
** Cons: Slower search when user invokes `EmailTagListCommand`, since it has to loop through each tag of
each email in the list of emails.

==== Logging
We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the
logging levels and logging destinations.

===== Current Implementation
* The logging level can be controlled using the logLevel
* The Logger for a class can be obtained using LogsCenter.getLogger(Class) which will log messages according
to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: Console and to a .log file in `data/logs` folder with the format
`"log" + "yyyyMMdd_HHmm" + ".log"`.
* Logging Levels
** SEVERE : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
** WARNING : Can continue, but with caution
** INFO : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
** FINE : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list
instead of just its size

=== Dev Ops
==== Build Automation
We use https://gradle.org/[Gradle] for _build automation.
See link:{repoURL}/tutorials/gradleTutorial.md[Gradle Tutorial] for more details.

==== Continuous Integration
We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.

==== Coverage Reporting
We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects.

==== Making a Release
Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the archiveVersion number of shadowJar in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

==== Managing Dependencies
A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, *Email manager* depends on the https://openjfx.io/[JavaFX] for GUI support. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle.
For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
