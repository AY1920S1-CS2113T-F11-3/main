Anyways, this question is about how extensive the offline capability must be for our project.<\/p>\r\n<p>To begin with, our group is implementing a movies information app and we are using an API (permission have been given by you to use the API) to do majority of the functions. The problem arises when we are unable to access the API when there is no internet.<\/p>\r\n<p>We have hence started storing various movies and their details in a JSON file located in our directory. However, even after trying various methods, it has been difficult or almost impossible to store the details about all the movies since there are almost\r\n around 500,000&#43; movies in the API and all these movies come with images such as movie posters and various information like movie plot summary which can take up enormous amount of space.<\/p>\r\n<p>So back to the question, I wanted to ask whether when operating the app offline, is it more than enough to just showcase the proof of concept if it is very difficult to provide accurate information for all the possible user commands? For example, our app\r\n provides a feature where users can search and afterwards access information about a particular movie by typing its title. When using the API, the app is able to show accurate results. But, when the app operates in the offline mode, the app may sometimes fail\r\n to show correct results as I can't possibly store information about all the 500,000 movies provided by the API in a file. In these situations, the app currently displays a wrong result or prints a message that the movie information is unavailable. Is this\r\n acceptable especially when it comes to testing in week 13 or would you still want the app to display correct and accurate information every time regardless of whether the app operates offline or not? How much will this affect our grading?<\/p>\r\n<p>I am sorry for typing such a long question but I wanted to ensure that you understand what I am asking. Thank you so much for taking the time to read and answer this question.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:small; color:#666\">\u2014<br>\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.<br>\r\nReply to this email directly, <a href=\"https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1920S1/forum/issues/74?email_source=notifications&amp;email_token=AKDI2IPY5AIESIZXHUT4JRDQO5LSBA5CNFSM4JBPGYJKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4HSHX6YQ\">\r\nview it on GitHub<\/a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AKDI2IJNF7D3MT2GTN7TNGLQO5LSBANCNFSM4JBPGYJA\">\r\nunsubscribe<\/a>.<img src=\"https://github.com/notifications/beacon/AKDI2IN46ANTGM4AYYGZZQDQO5LSBA5CNFSM4JBPGYJKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4HSHX6YQ.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\r\n<\/body>\r\n<\/html>\r\n"}}
